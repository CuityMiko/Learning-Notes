This is my notebook for the book [*Automate_the_Boring_Stuff_with_Python*](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/#toc). You could access this book for free. Thanks for the author Al Sweigart, we could have this wonderful learning metirials for python beginners.

Because the book didn't give solutions for the **Practice Projects**, so I add my solutions for other learners.

I hope this could help those people who study this book.
